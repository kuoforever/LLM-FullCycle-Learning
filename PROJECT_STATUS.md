## Current phase

The Desktop Runtime Lane A producer, strict consumer, and deterministic
Reliability/Verifier Dataset v1 mapping now form a pinned offline baseline. The
next phase freezes its environment and CI evidence before model work starts.

## Single active objective

Complete `FC-MVP-000` in this repository:

```text
bridge + reliability dataset baseline
        -> locked Python environment and offline validation gate
        -> Python 3.11-3.13 CI evidence and reproducible baseline record
```

Freeze the current consumer and dataset contracts without adding model,
provider, Runtime, or capture features. Record the dependency/environment lock,
run the same offline fixture gate on Python 3.11-3.13, and preserve exact
producer, consumer, dataset-schema, fixture, and validation identities. Do not
start Tool Router training or Lane B under this item.

`FC-BRIDGE-001` completed on 2026-07-28 with consumer schema `1.0.0`, Runtime
commit `8ace897f746a4aa3dd3f8b10af392ea9ba81941d`, one valid producer-pinned
manifest, one minimal valid run export, and eight invalid fixtures. Validation
on Python 3.13.7: `12 tests` passed, Ruff passed, mypy passed, and the offline
CLI accepted the valid fixture with the pinned manifest digest. The repository
is local-only with no configured remote.

`FC-BRIDGE-002` completed on 2026-07-28 with
`reliability_dataset_schema_version=1`, a strict Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema, a
canonical JSONL mapper, two exact input/output fixtures, and deterministic
failure, unknown-outcome, policy-denial, recovery, budget-limit, and
tool-sequence signals. Validation on Python 3.13.7: `21 tests` passed, Ruff
passed, mypy passed, the JSON Schema and two records validated, and the offline
script reproduced both JSONL records byte-for-byte.

Detailed technical tasks remain in
`AI_Infra_LLM_Agent_待做任务清单.md`. This file owns only sequencing and the
single active objective.

## Session start

1. Read `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Read this file.
3. Read `README.md`.
4. Read only the roadmap or task section required by the active item.
5. Inspect the target repository's status before editing.

## Session end

1. Record modified files and validation results.
2. Update one backlog status.
3. Set one exact next objective.
4. Do not report planned capabilities as implemented.
5. If Runtime contracts changed, update
   `Desktop_Runtime_依赖与集成.md` and the consumer fixture together.

## Current decisions

- One flagship project and four depth Labs.
- Desktop GUI is the first environment, not the permanent product boundary.
- Runtime owns execution safety; Full Cycle owns models and datasets.
- Automatic Runtime export is redacted reliability evidence only.
- Rich multimodal episodes require explicit consent and a separate review.
- Multi-Agent is formal Project H but does not block the first closed loop.
- Runtime Lane A producer v1 passed `1428` tests plus Ruff, mypy, docs, wheel
  build/install, and offline release gates, then PR #219 passed the Python
  3.11-3.13 and wheel CI gates and merged as `8ace897` on 2026-07-28.
